EXERCISES 3.A



4. $T_{v_1},\cdots,T_{v_m}$ is a linear independent list
by addivity of $T$ï¼Œ
$T(c_1v_1)+T(c_2v_2)+\cdots+T(c_mv_m)$ is a unique vector in $W$.
thus, $c_1,c_2,\dots,c_m$ uniquely determine the vector in $W$
since uniqueness of vector in $W, therefore we conclude that $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent.
